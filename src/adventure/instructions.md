## Game Instructions

Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file.  The instructions should be clear enough for any
non-technical computer user to understand and follow.

This text-based adventure game allows you to maneuver your player through a dark cave in search of treasures and
 monsters. To begin, the game will prompt you to enter your desired player name. Once you have entered a name for
  your player, you will have the opportunity to roam through the cave with the options shown in the terminal. Note
   that you need not only enter the single character representation of the options provided, but you may also enter
    the complete word (i.e. South instead of S, West instead of W, etc.) in order to move your player to the next room. 
    
There is a total of 10 rooms you can go through, some that promise treasures, others that promise death. It is up to
 you which path you decide to go down. Good luck!
